  ## Features
  A quick app using Node to generate an svg image. Select between multiple colors and choose from three different shapes.  

  ## How to Use This Application
  Fork the code into your IDE. Ensure you have the proper dependencies installed. Open your integrated terminal and run node. node index.js will prompt the questions.

  ## Tests 
  There are multiple tests involved. Each for a particular shape. Currently you will get a pass and a fail as multiple variables are at fault. Will continue to debug.
